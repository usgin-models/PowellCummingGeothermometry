===========================
This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for data on geothermomtery - gas and aqueous chemical observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

Specific liquid and gas analyte suites in the Excel workbook have been tailored for use in the analysis formulated by Powell and Cumming, 2010. Analytes reported with this content model match those in the Powell and Cumming, 2010 spreadsheets and can be directly inputted into their model, which creates numerous ternary diagrams and other Excel graphics to create a geothermomerty report.

Note that this repository and information exchange superceeds PowellCummingsGeothermometry, which was incorrectly named with the "s" in Cummings. This is version 2, to which all services will be updated.
